# Connect4Wins - README
Overview
Connect4Wins is a classic two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one of their colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color consecutively vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.
